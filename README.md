## Train (your algo)

Train your machine learning algo with games that can be played in parallel. Or, you know, if you wanted the challenge of playing 1000 games of knock-off minesweeper at once, you could do that too.

All games speak the common tongue of `[]byte`, so your ML algo must generate some msg in `[]byte`. I have chosen this method for quite a few reasons, and would love to discuss it further if you have any ideas on the topic. Personally, I believe that suitably general encoding and interfaces to interact are absolutely vital to the capabilities of a learning system. "In order to find a solution, the algo must be able to search"
