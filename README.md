## Train (your algo)

Train your machine learning algo with games that can be played in parallel. Or, you know, if you wanted the challenge of playing 1000 games of knock-off minesweeper at once, you could do that too. :smile:

All games speak the lingua franca that is `[]byte`, so your ML algo must generate some msg in `[]byte`. I have chosen this method for quite a few reasons, and would love to discuss it further if you have any ideas on the topic.
