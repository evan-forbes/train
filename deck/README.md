# deck

The deck package works as an unordered tracker of Cards (string) between players. It's reasonably fast, thread safe, and each deck has it's own source of competent but psuedo randomness. There are also a few tools included to make highly customizable sets of cards to put in your deck (see example_deck.go).

Keep in mind that this package isn't really meant for making a card game app, although you could do that. The api is focused on being a versitile card tracker for teaching algorithms how to play cards. There are boatloads of other deck like packages that would probably better suite (ha!) an app.
